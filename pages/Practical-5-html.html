        HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages. Hypertext 
            refers to the way in which web pages(HTML documents) are linked together. Thus, the link available on the webpage
            is called Hypertext.As its name suggests,HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up"
            a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.Originally, HTML was developed
            with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings,paragraphs,lists and so forth to facilitate 
            the sharing of scientific information between reserchers.
