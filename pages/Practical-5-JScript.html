            JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted scripting language. It is well-known for the
            development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side
            developments as well as Server-side developments.
            JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”. The programs in this language are called scripts. 
            They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads. Scripts are provided 
            and executed as plain text.
