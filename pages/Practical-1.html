    <h3 style="color: blueviolet;">About Course</h3>
    <p>It refers to the development of both front end(client side) and back end(server side) portions of web application. Web 
        development has become one of the most innovative and important areas of the IT industry. The advancements in the realm 
        of dynamic content have enabled us to buy and sell products on the Internet, share our daily lives (for better or worse) 
        with all of our friends, and create complex International banking and trading websites. It was not long ago when the idea 
        of dynamically storing and providing content through the Internet was an unrealistic concept – certainly in terms of modern 
        usage at least. Primarily through the advancement of databases like MySQL and server-side programming languages like Perl, 
        Ruby, and most significantly PHP, dynamic and responsive websites have become standard and are expected by consumers. The 
        amount of knowledge and skill-set diversity that a modern web developer must have is significant, though the process is much 
        more manageable than it seems at first glance. Let’s take a look at what a dynamic website actually is from a technology 
        standpoint and then investigate what role each of these technologies play.</p>
